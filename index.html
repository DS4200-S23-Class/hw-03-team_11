        <h2> Marks </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> the first mark, going from top to bottom, is the line of the bar chart.</li>
          <li> the second mark would be area because of the spatial chart of the US.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Channels </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> For the bar chart, we are looking at  horizontal positional channels because we need at least 270 electoral votes to win.</li>
          <li> The bottom  chart uses color channel between the two parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Colormaps </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Colormap 1 </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Both the bar chart and spatial US chart use categorical coloring.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    
    <!-- These are the bullets for the right hand side of the second chart -->
        <h2 class= "spacing"> Marks </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> The marks are points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Channels </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> The channels are horizontal, vertical, and color.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Colormaps </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> The colormap is an ordinal divergent because you are diverging from the average either below or above. It is ordinal because the color has a specific meaning like purple being below average and orange being above average.   </li>
        </ul>

    <!-- These are the bullets for the right hand side of the third chart -->
       <h2 class= "spacing_2"> Marks </h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Because this is a racetrack being filled in the mark is an area.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2> Channels </h2>
          <ul>
            <li> The channels are color.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2> Colormaps </h2>
          <ul>
            <li> The colormap is an ordinal divergent because you are diverging from the center being 0, or no difference in speed between either driver. It is ordinal because the color has a specific meaning like purple being below speed and above being above average in Kph.   </li>
          </ul>
